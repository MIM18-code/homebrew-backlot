  caveats <<~EOS
    Backlot is not signed or notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, run
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Backlot.app
    or use Open Anyway in System Settings > Privacy & Security after the
    first attempt.

    PDF printing needs Google Chrome. Script and budget engines are optional;
    see the README for BACKLOT_SCRIPT_PY and BACKLOT_BUDGET_PY.
